# Seoul-Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction
The goal of the project is to predict number of rental bikes required at each hour for stable supply of rental bikes. Various Regression machine learning algorithms have been applied on the dataset to get the best possible prediction. Some of the key takeaways from this project are -

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the data to gain some insights.
Treated the outliers using log transformation.
Label encoding was done for categorical variables.
4.Standard Scaler was used to scale down the data.
5.Applied 8 machine learning models and Regularization methods on the dataset i.e,

Linear Regression

Stochastic Gradient Descent

Decission Tree

Random Forest Classifier.

Bagging Regressor

Gradient Boosting Regressor

XGBoost.

Stacking Regressor

6.Hyperparameter tuning was performed on all the models using Grid Search CV to get best parameters and best scores.

7.Key Achievement: Stacking came out to be the perfect winner - R2 Score (91%) and Adjusted R2 Score (90%)
